1.2 - 19-03-2017 - 2400 elo, this time for real? :P
- improved passed-pawn scoring in endgames
- added time to UCI output
- improved time control: x moves in y minutes
- 2 transposition tables: always replace and depth replacement scheme
- made transposition-table-size configurable
- all draw scores are now exactly 0 and stored in the TT
- bugs, again ;)


1.1 09-02-2017 (2400 elo)
- re-enabled mobility evaluation
- knight outposts
- implemented king safety (using Ed Schroders idea), but disabled for the moment
- check-aware quiescence-search
- bug fixes, of course


1.0 13-01-2017 (2300 elo)
- (magic) bitboards
- transposition table
- (internal) iterative-deepening
- killer-moves and history-heuristics for move ordering
- principal variation search
- null-move pruning
- late-move-reductions
- static exchange evaluation
- aspiration window
- has NO mobility evaluation because the performance impact was too high
