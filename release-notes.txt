1.3 - 26-04-2017 - 2500 elo
- enabled king-safety (based on Ed Schr√∂ders idea)
- implemented razoring
- implemented static nullmove pruning
- recognition of bishop and rook underpromotions (so it doesn't crash anymore)
- changed pawn-shield and pawn-storm implementation
- updated LMR
- fixed running out of time
- fixed some engine crashes


1.2 - 19-03-2017 - 2400 elo, this time for real? :P
- improved passed-pawn scoring in endgames
- added time to UCI output
- improved time control: x moves in y minutes
- 2 transposition tables: always replace and depth replacement scheme

1.0 - 13-01-2017 - 2300 elo
- (magic) bitboards

- (internal) iterative-deepening
- killer-moves and history-heuristics for move ordering
- principal variation search
- null-move pruning
- late-move-reductions
- static exchange evaluation
- aspiration window
